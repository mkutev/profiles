This Utility is meant as a optional and modular plugin that adjusts the current Hip and Lower Back cloth colliders to be not so bulbous while also avoiding clipping (as much as possible, some armors may have something that could poke through a cape/cloak)

2 sets of colliders was created just for capes/cloaks/shoulder worn items, and a set for armor (head, chest, legs) so that everything works together nicely.

This in no way alters the play or feel of the game, only that the player's model can now interact more with Cloth base Physics wearable gear. It can be removed or added at any time (if you find or feel this may be causing any performance issues on your end)

        

        Version 3.0.1
            Hot Fix for on Player Death, Ragdoll's throwing errors for collider creation.
        Version 3.0.0
            Split colliders for capes and armor to make 2 sets
            Adjusted Collider Size values again (I think left arm will make the lox cape deform oddly again, trying to find that right balance still, but all other capes are fine)
        Version 2.0.0
            Adjusted all Colliders except the shoulders/chest collider (now a bit more form fitting)
            Added two more colliders that only take effect for things worn in the shoulder slot (capes), this will allow capes to be a bit further from the body and avoid some oddness around the feet area
        Version 1.0.0
            Tweaked Hip's Cloth Collider Direction to X axis instead of Y (across hips, instead up up and down torso) and Size (Height and Radius) also pushed it a bit back more (behind player)
            Tweaked Lower Back's Cloth Collider Size (Radius)
            Added Cloth Colliders to the Upper and Lower arms
            Added Cloth Colliders to the Lower Legs and Feet
