# Mining

Adds a mining skill that increases damage dealt while mining and item yield from ore deposits.

Starting at skill level 50, there is a tiny chance that hitting an ore deposit will make it explode. There is a shortcut (default: CTRL + T) to toggle this on and off.

Can be installed on a server, to enforce the configuration.
