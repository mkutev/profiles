## Notes
**Do not install my Barbarian armor and Plate armor mods from nexusmods, they are included in this mod**  

Blacksmith's tools is not a hard dependency, the mod will work without it. You'll just run into armors clipping with player body.  
The mod makes no use of blacksmith's tool's bone reoder, you may disable it if you wish.  
Use the mod on a server to sync configs.  
Using [Hugo's more and modified cloth colliders](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/HugotheDwarf/More_and_Modified_Player_Cloth_Colliders/) is recommended  
In case of questions you may find me on the [Modding discord server](https://discord.gg/MXqWrn532w)

After launching the game the mod will generate configuration files for items, recipes and localization  

Item stats and recipes can be edited in ``GoldenJude_JudesEquipment_ItemConfig.yml``  
Localization can be edited in ``GoldenJude_JudesEquipment_Localization.yml``  
Armor metal colors and emission can be edited in ``GoldenJude_JudesEquipment_Colors.yml`` using hex color codes  
  
Modifiers for health regen, stamina regen and jump and sprint stamina drain are in percentages therefore ``health regen modifier: 25`` will increase health regen by 25%  
Valid values for damage modifiers are: ``Ignore, Immune, Normal, Resistant, VeryResistant, VeryWeak, Weak``  
List for Valheim's vanilla skill list: ``None, All, Axes, Blocking, Bows, Clubs, Jump, Knives, Pickaxes, Polearms, Ride, Run, Sneak, Spears, Swim, Swords, Unarmed, WoodCutting``  
Names for crafting stations and items can be found on the Valheim wiki under ``Internal ID``  

Each armor piece's metallic color can be adjusted in ``JudesEquipment_Colors.yml`` to fit custom materials, this config is not synced
