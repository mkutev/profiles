Adds a death feed to your server. The death feed will display the most recent player deaths on your server.

You can use drag and drop to move the list around. Use ESC to free your mouse, for example.

Can be installed on the server, to enforce the death texts from the server and to add a Discord webhook (in the config file on the server), to post all deaths to a Discord channel.
